## Transformer-based Seq2Seq Machine Translation Model ##

### Implemented in Pytorch/Allennlp ###

====== Project description: ======
1. Folder "corpora" contains the training data (bilingual-parallel text).
2. Folder "trained" contains the trained models and their vocabularies.
3. Script "translationTrain.ipynb" is used to perform training of the model.
4. Script predict.ipynb is used to load a trained model and perform translations.

See trained folder README for models description. 
See corpora folder README for dataset description.
